# MyPitt.edu-Redesign

The my.pitt rework team has designed a test tool using Adobe XD in order to simulate a potential redesign for the website. Our purpose is to gain feedback about user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The design is a functional network of UI and graphical content, however it is not implemented in Hypertext Markup Language (html) with Pitt systems is a deeply involved process and would require significant investment of time and cooperation with University of Pittsburgh employees and leadership. At the current stage of testing, it is desirable to gain feedback on the most basic aspects of UX: is it easily navigable? Does the layout make sense? What improvements need to be made? Is it visually appealing? Once those aspects have gained sufficient feedback and the design has incorporated the results, further work for a more comprehensive testing system would be advisable. We are looking for test users to interact with our deliverable to offer us insights towards improving the UI design.
